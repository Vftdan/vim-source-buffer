Plugin for sourcing buffers and ranges.

This plugin creates a separate script for each buffer, allowing to use local variables. Files are written only once for each user for each buffer number.

## Installation

```vim
Plug 'vftdan/vim-source-buffer'
" or:
Plug 'vftdan/vim-source-buffer', { 'do': 'mkdir sourcebufferfiles' }
```
