*sourcebuffer.txt* Plugin for sourcing buffers and ranges

This plugin creates a separate script for each buffer, allowing to use
local variables. Files are written only once for each user for each buffer
number.

Scripts are placed into sourcebufferfiles/ directory inside your
|'runtimepath'|.

						*:SourceBuffer*
:[range]SourceBuffer	Source [range] lines (default: whole buffer)
			from current buffer.

					*sourcebuffer#source_range()*
sourcebuffer#source_range({buf}, {start}, {end})
		Executes lines from {start} to {end} from buffer {buf}
		Argument {buf} should be an integer (|expr-number|).
		Code is executed using |:execute|.
		See also: |getbufline()|.
